### IRC log file recovery

Isthmus 2022

Unfortunately, a lot of Noncesense Research Lab results from 2018-2019 were posted to IRC but not backed up to GitHub. Thankfully, the research is not lost to the sands of time, since files uploaded by IRCcloud users can be recovered automatically from logs. See `main.py` or `main.ipynb` (same functionality) for the automatic parse-and-scrape script.

For files recovered from the public Monero Research Lab channel, see `/data/version_controlled/recovered_files`
